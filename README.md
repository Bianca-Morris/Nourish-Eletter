# Nourish International E-letter### Who?This html/css was written by Bianca Morris to be used by Nourish International Wellesley, a student organization at Wellesley College dedicated to alleviating global poverty.### What?This is an email newsletter, meant to be sent and received via gmail, the email client of choice for the college.### When?Spring 2015### Why?As Director of Communications for the Nourish International Wellesley Chapter, itâ€™s my job to improve and maintain relationships within and without the organization. After having achieved high success with our 2015 Giving Challenge fundraiser (we raised $1,275), we wanted to come up with something really special to thank the people who donated to our cause.### How?I completed this project using mostly HTML, and some in-line CSS. Note that this project was completed with entirely self-taught knowledge; I have had no formal training in HTML/CSS. No framework was used to structure this document, since as far as I know, tables are the most consistently supported method for structuring email documents. At this point in time, I had no training in responsive design, so I hacked together a way to make it work on different browser sizes by defining widths and heights with percentages. This makes the document behave a little strangely on extremely wide monitor sizes, since the images all scale to be a specific portion of the page width. To see what I'm talking about here, check it out at the link at the bottom. ```View it in-browser (here)[https://dash.generalassemb.ly/Ballyn/build-your-own-personal-website].```
